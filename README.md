# DIVINE 
#### SIMPLE TAROT

#### Abstract
DIVINE is a virtual tarot deck for beginners who don't want to invest in buying a physical deck and memorizing all the card meanings. The app allows beginners to instantly get their first reading, without bogging them down with extra information. These cards are simply designed and have the name, type, suit, and description for the card. Upon opening the app, the user is given a random card. They can take this as their daily reading, or they can click "Draw A Card" to randomly pull a card. The user is able to search for cards by name or terms in the description. Cards can be favorited and viewed on the favorites page. The user may favorite or un-favorite a card from any page and it will be updated accurately in the store and on the DOM.

#### Project Next Steps
